"1","[1] \"This lot contains 2x Rollei TLR cameras. One is a Rolleiflex with Tessar 75mm F/3.5 lenses. This camera does fire but it was not tested for accuracy. Some regular marks on the housing of the camera. Leather a bit peeling off. Some dust inside lenses. Aperture and speed dails turn, although a bit heavy. Needs some cleaning and adjustments but will most likely be revivable back to fully working spec. The rolleicord is more a decorative item, the lenses are really matte, fogged up or scratched, this also is noticable when looking through the wlf. nice cosmetics, no real damages and this one comes with the original leather case. Shutter does move but not as intended. Sold as collectors items. no warranty on functionality\"
